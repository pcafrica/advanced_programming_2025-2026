# Screen recording policy

During the entire duration of part 2 of the exam, students are required to perform a **continuous screen recording of the computer screen**, without audio and without webcam.

The recording:
- remains in the **sole possession of the student**;
- **must not be uploaded or submitted automatically**;
- must be **kept until the evaluation process is completed**.

The instructor may **request the screen recording only in the presence of justified doubts** regarding the regularity of the exam (i.e., concerning the use of AI tools or communication channels) or the coherence between the submitted solution and the expected competences.

In case of a request, the student must provide the recording according to the instructions and deadlines communicated by the instructor.

**Failure to provide the recording upon a justified request**, in the absence of documented technical issues, may result in:
- annulment of the exam attempt, or
- a mandatory oral verification.

Any recordings that are requested will be used **exclusively for evaluation purposes**, accessed only by the instructor, and **deleted after the evaluation is finalized**, in compliance with applicable data protection regulations.

# Screen recording tools
Students may use **any reliable screen recording software**, provided that the recording:
- covers the **entire screen**;
- is **continuous** for the full duration of the exam;
- does **not include audio or webcam**.

The preferred option, working on all operating systems, is **OBS Studio** (Windows, macOS, Linux) ([official documentation](https://obsproject.com/kb/quick-start-guide)).

Simpler OS-native alernatives are also acceptable, such as:
- **Windows**: [Xbox Game Bar](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/use-a-screen-reader-to-record-your-screen-with-xbox-game-bar-5328cd25-9046-4472-8a14-c485f138802c) (`Win + Alt + R`)
- **macOS**: [Built-in Screen Recording](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721) (`Cmd + Shift + 5`)
- **Linux**:
  - [GNOME Screen Recorder](https://itsfoss.com/gnome-screen-recorder/) (`Ctrl + Alt + Shift + R`), or
  - [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/)

Students are responsible for verifying **before the exam** that their chosen tool works correctly and that sufficient disk space is available.
